I am a graduate from Bishop Dunne finishing 5th in my class with a 4.1 GPA and a 1st Team All State Strong safety. I now attend UTA and I am currently a Junior majoring in Aerospace Engineering.

### More Information

I've been on the Dean's list, I played college football for a little while until I desided to mainly pursue my dream of becoming a Professional Engineer and starting my own business one day. I am currently a motivational speaker, and I go back to my hometown to speak at elementary schools. I am constantly striving to be better than yesterday.
